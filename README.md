# CSDS345_SLI
Simple Language Interpreter Project for CSDS 345

The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for a language related to Java or C, which can evaluate expressions, implement a parser, store binding pairs, separate states, and return the proper value amongst other detailed functions of an interpreter.

Existing project files given to students include **part1tests.html**, **simpleParser.rkt**, and **lex.rkt**. 

The created project file will be saved as a .rkt extension/as a Racket file.
